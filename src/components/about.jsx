    <p>
      I am an organized, creative and solution oriented python developer who
      believes that process optimization is the key to an efficient business.

      After having worked with data for several years in different sectors (CSO,
      Project Management, Data Cleansing), I have decided to devote myself to
      software development. My prior experiences helped me acquire an analytical
      mindset and allows me to better understand the needs and professional
      habits of clients.

      Being very keen on learning, I love to undertake custom client-projects.
